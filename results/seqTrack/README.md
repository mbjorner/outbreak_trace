### What is seqTrack, though?

[seqTrack](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3183872/) is an R package. Its goal is to reconstruct outbreak transmission trees using time and sequence data, along with any other epidemiological data.

### Usage notes:

It's in R. library(seqTrack) should be enough to import it. 

It's really fast! No complaints tbh.
