### Graph visualizations of output:

#### The following are 4 images of output. The first is a representation of the true ancestry relationships


![True graph](true_graph.jpg?raw=true "true graph")

![outbreaker2 graph](outbreaker2_graph.jpg?raw=true "outbreaker2 graph")

![seqTrack graph](seqTrack_graph.jpg?raw=seqTrack graph")

![PhyML graph](PhyML_graph.jpg?raw=true "PhyML graph")



note: Connection to NA implies the root of the graph, and no ancestor. Treat any nodes connected to NA as the root of their own tree.
