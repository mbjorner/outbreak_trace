## Results using the online implementation of [PhyML](http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/). 

This can also be accomplished with the [PhyML R implementation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ape/versions/5.4-1/topics/phymltest) which uses the ape package,

This method **does not** make use of time-series data, and relies upon genetic differences.

PhyML's integrated SMS (model selection) found GTR to be the best model for the data. GTR is the general time-reversible model.
