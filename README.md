# outbreak_trace

Fall 2020 BMI 826 Project Repository:

Graphical and Phylogenetic Models of Outbreak Transmission Trees


### project proposal
BMI Project Proposal (22OCT2020) provides objectives and motivations behind project.


### datasets

2009 H1N1 Data
- originally published by Jombart et al. 2011 // in folder [H1N1 dataset](https://github.com/mbjorner/outbreak_trace/tree/main/H1N1%20dataset)

Simulated Data
- from outbreak2 // found in [runOutbreaker2.R](https://github.com/mbjorner/outbreak_trace/tree/main/executables)
- from R method provided by Jombart et al. 2011 // [genSimulatedOutbreak.R](https://github.com/mbjorner/outbreak_trace/tree/main/executables)

  - this contains both methods for creating simulated data using structured dispersal and random diffusion

### algorithms / methods

#### graph structures:
- SeqTrack algortihm developed by Jombart et. al. 2011
- outbreaker2

#### phylo tree structures:
- BEAST
- PhyML 3.0

### results
